====== Faction Shake-down ======
Created Sunday 17 March 2019

- step outside to a rolling battle in the street
- it's hard to make out but it looks as though there migh be about twenty people on each side - townsfolk you recognise
- you have never seen this much bloodshed carried out by people you //know// - people have butcher's hooks, farming sickles, clubs, axes...
- Shadow's cultists are all sporting silver scale tattoos
- other townsfolk have all manner of indiscriminate 'protection from evil' festooned about themselves : horseshoes, cloves of garlic etc.

- you are stunned for a minute : "what do you do?"
- if they just dither for a bit have the dragon leap into the fray and they have to chase after it


MECHANICS:
//Moving through the fight// - risk of getting hit by stray attacks 
	- each roll a d20-2 every time they try to move. If this is higher than their AC take 1d4 damage (roll a d6 for bludgeoning/piercing/slashing) 
//Joining the fight on one side //- simulate fighting on one side of the battle
	- each take on two commoners, with flavour about fighting alongside allies etc
//Trying to take on everybody at once //
	- each take on three commoners, with flavour about everyone attacking each other
	

- Sheriff Adran breaks it up at the end by firing his crossbow into the air
- (if they were fighting, let them defeat specified number of people then describe the last few people desisting)

**STATS:**
Commoners: p345 MM
