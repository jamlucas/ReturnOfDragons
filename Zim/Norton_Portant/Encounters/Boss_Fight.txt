**XP ~ 1600**

Knight - 700 XP
4x Guards - (25 XP) - 100XP

Tactics:
Agent Norton: Round 1 uses his Leadership action to inspire his guards
	Quixotic - goes for the person who seems like most of a 'worthy challenge' - spars with them
	Hangs back until at least one guard has been defeated
	When the guards start fleeing moves in for the dragon himself
	
Guards: go for whoever has the dragon - their aim is to get the dragon and get out
	They'll try to stay together, at least in pairs, and mob people/take down easy targets on their way to get the dragon
	Will disengage or flee when they or the guard next to them is on 4 HP or lower

**STATS:** 
Guards + Knight: p 347 MM
