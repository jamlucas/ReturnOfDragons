Shadow is friendly but kind of unsettling

"Dragons returning are the herald of a new age"
Taking magic mushrooms and going into trances and trying to see the gods
Getting visions of golden dragons

They want to protect Snuffles too, though you get the sense that they'd actually quite like to keep him

Shadow and 8 other cultists
