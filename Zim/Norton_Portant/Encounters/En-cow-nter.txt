Lashed to a cart (lashed together)
One has mad cow disease and will literally fight to the death

	- to attack the person that a) is drawing the most attention/moved the most or b) attacked it last
The other is just a very scared cow
	- tactics: will fight to escape - makes a strength check (CR 17)
	- then runs at whoever is standing in the way of it to get away - make sure you know where people are
