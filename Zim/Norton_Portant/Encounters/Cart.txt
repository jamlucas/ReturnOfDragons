====== Cart ======
Created Sunday 17 March 2019

- Guards are guarding the wagon, but slightly distracted and playing dice, don't feel threatened by the kids
- Make it obvious that you could break into this cart / that the guards are easy to distract
- See map

If a fight is provoked: they are just aiming to subdue to children - 
	- if the going gets tough they call the sleeping Night Watch
	- if anyone gets dropped to 4HP or lower they run to fetch Norton/barricade themselves inside the cart (which provides cover and has a sphere of dispell magic in it)

**STATS:**
Golem Horse: (Clay Golem) p168 MM - shouldn't need to fight it though
Guards: p347 MM

(500 XP encounter if (10x) guards are all fought)
