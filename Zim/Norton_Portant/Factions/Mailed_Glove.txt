Agent Norton Portant (Open Hand)
5x Thugs (Clenched Fist)
10x Guards (government soldiers)

Norton Portant - Basically the MiB - wants to take the dragon back to the capital to be studied
Contemptuous of the town
Attempts to install curfew maybe

Stuff he knows but won't tell you
They know about the dragon because their organisation has access to an orb in the capital that can sense dragons in some vague way
His boss is just "The Starred Palm"
