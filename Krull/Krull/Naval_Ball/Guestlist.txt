**Character Notes**

__Countess Jennifer Ouzel__
//Bonds: //Cares deeply for her husband and daughter
//Flaws: //Unrestrained in her quest for power
//What she wants: //To consolidate her position as Master of Ships with the rest of the Great and the Good.

__Count George Ouzel__
//Bonds: //Cares deeply for his wife and daughter
//Flaws: //Extremely arrogant but just NO taste
//What he wants: //To rub his new power and wealth in everyone's faces, particularly Guizam's. Gleeful about this. Very slimy individual.

__Vanessa Ouzel__
//Bonds: //Dutiful towards her mother and father, but her heart belongs to Morwen, hobgoblin warlord of Monsterfell
//Flaws: //Arguably, the above!
//What she wants: //To not have to dance with any more "eligable young nobles".
//Long term goals: //To be with Morwen, though she's not sure how.

__Th'uvi Brindlepaw ("Tabby")__
//Bonds:// My only loyalty is to Tabaxi
//Flaws:// I like my wine, and afterwards I like to gossip
//What he wants:// To be the centre of attention/ to impress everyone with how great Tabaxi is. Incredibly flirty - some kind of comment on Guizam's outfit (particularly if there's any naval detailing - "hel-lo sailor").
//Long term goals:// To place an advisor in the Emperor's court to ensure that Tabaxi has some control over the very influencable Emperor.

__Maria Starling__
//Bonds: //I look out for the interests of the Thieves Guild
//Flaws: //I trust no-one, not even my underlings
//What she wants: //Not particularly interested in hob-nobbing - though the Ouzels want to hob-nob with her. Etremely interested in how this place came to be robbed when the Ouzels had paid their dues to the Guild. Attempts to sneak about and interview the servants.
//Long term goals: //To have the Thieves Guild as the most important faction in the city.

__Jeren Tealeaf__
//What she wants: //Actually really sociable and enjoys parties and dancing. Asks after Crusher. Somewhat tentative of you, as you did almost arrest her, but very ready to warm up to you if any effort is made.

__Lord Marcus Teal__
//Bonds: //Restoring my family's glory (and wealth) is important to me
//Flaws: //Lost money gambling, bit of a bully
//What he wants: //To make allies amongst the disaffected nobles. Will seek Guizam out to dance with him and try to co-opt/convince/threaten him into joining "the Liberteers".
//Long term goals: //To overthrow the Emperor and put someone more sympathetic to the Old Houses in charge.

__Nimh__
//Bonds: //Devout
//Flaws: //I take things way too seriously and it's hard to have fun
//What she wants: //Attending to do her duty as the representative of Powick's temple. If she can (gently) convince other people to come down to the Temple and learn more, so much the better.
