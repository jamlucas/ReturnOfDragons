DWARVEN CLERIC
Steward

- approaching 60, but still vigorous

//Personality trait: //I am canny in the ways of politics and the city, and I want to pass that knowledge on to the Oments, who are sometimes exasperatingly naiive.

//Bond:// At the end, at the very end, to cover my own back. If Lady Oment is proved innocent so, by extension, am I. If I need to kill the Emperor to ensure I'm not persecuted, I might do. If I need to kill Lady Oment to stop her inditing me - I also might do.

//Flaw: //I am single minded in persuing the interests of the Oment family, and of myself.

- he and Crusher are entrusted to run the Estate if for any reason the Oments are away

- was educated by the church, and can channel the divine magic of Corallion
- 'divine magic' means you've trained to become the conduit of Corallion on earth
- Berem is not particularly devout, but each use of 'divine magic' does tend to make him more so (though in his usual day-to-day stewarding he doesn't have cause to use it much)

- worked as a member of the Jewellers Guild in Dwarfhold
- many dwarven merchants left the mountains to become stewards in the major cities of the Empire of Krull, especially if they weren't from one of the dominant clans
