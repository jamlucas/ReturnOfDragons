====== Liberteers ======
Created Friday 15 March 2019

The Liberteers are at present headed by the hacked off and headstrong Lord Marcus Teal, a disaffected nobleman.
They wear black and red (cloth) carnations to signal to each other who they are.

With Marcus at the helm, their aims are to replace the Emperor with a "Senate" - though this itself is going to be a tightly controlled oligarchy, headed by Marcus and cronies if he has anything to do with it. Specifically NOT by any Tradesman's Guilds. At the moment though they don't really have a plan. Marcus vaguely plans to assassainate the Emperor, their family, their advisors and a selection of noble "fire and blood!" next time they're in the city, but doesn't actually know when that will be.

Other people in the organisation might want something more genuinely revolutionary - but probably all contradictory.
