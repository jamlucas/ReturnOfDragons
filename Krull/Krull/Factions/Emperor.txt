====== Emperor ======
Created Friday 15 March 2019

The Emperor is paranoid and weak and controlled by Their advisors.

**Lady Oment's Plot**
//Lady Oment: thin, birdlike, grey hair, constantly restless, uncompromising and proud//
Was legitimately involved in a plot to kill the Emperor, using her role as Master of Ships to sink the Imperial Barge at the 'Marriage of the Sea' ceremony at Midsummer.
This boat-sinking part of the plot was never discovered, and in fact it is still in the back of [[Associates:Berem Gemcutter|Berem]]'s mind to go through with it.
Lady Oment was then going to make a play for ruler - her motivation being that she doesn't think that the current Emperor is strong enough to defend against threats from Monsterfell as that region becomes squeezed and volatile.
She was dobbed in by another member of her plot - took Countess Ouzel in on things to support her play for leadership (floated with an offer to marry Guizam to Vanessa). Countess Ouzel betrayed her to increase her own social standing - she has a servant working for the Emperor and intends to poison Them. By turning over Lady Oment's plot the Ouzels have stepped in to the powerful Master of Ships role, in order to be better placed to step into a leadership vaccuum herself.
