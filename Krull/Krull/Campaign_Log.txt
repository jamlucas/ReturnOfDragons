**Session 1**

Following the sudden arrest of his mother for treason, Guizam finds himself managing the Northshore estate. His steward, [[Associates:Berem Gemcutter|Berem Gemcutter]], brings him the mornings letters: a summary of finances, an invitation to a Diamond Ball in a week's time from Countess and Count Ouzel, an imperious letter from the Emperor instructing him to investigate the missing peacocks in the Botannic Gardens, a letter from a "businessman" with a "business opportunity", and a letter from farmer Giles of Appleby, who is having trouble with people smashing up his pumpkin fields.

After sending a note back to the mysterious "businessman" via a trained magpie waiting at the gate, Guizam takes Berem and [[Associates:Crusher|Crusher]] to investigate the Botannic Gardens. At the gate they meet the Imperial Gardener [[Associates:Jeren Tealeaf|Jeren Tealeaf]] who shows them around the magical flower hybrids she has created. It becomes immediately clear that she hates those peacocks, whose massive Peacockarium dwarfs all other buildings in the Gardens. In the hedge maze in the middle of the garden they are ambushed by twig blights. Guizam surmises that these were transplanted here by Tealeaf in order to kill the peacocks, she flees when confronted. After easily defeating the blights, the party catches up to Tealeaf as she packs up her botannical equipment in the gardener's cottage. Backtracking on his original plan to turn her in to the authorities, Guizam sits down with Tealeaf to come to an agreement over 'Name of the Rose'-tea. He won't turn her in, she can keep tending to her flowers, but she can't kill any more peacocks and she now owes him a favour. He informs the authorities that the peacocks were killed by wolves, and Tealeaf leaves Crusher with a bag of rose tea.

The next day, the "businessman" arrives, a halfling dressed entirely in purple velvet with a trained magpie, who introduces himself as [[Associates:Francesco|Francesco]]. His business opportunity boils down to using Guizam's money to finance a new rival to the Thieves Guild, who hold a monopoly on crime in the city. Though exceptionally doubtful, Guizam agrees to the plan, and even to making up the third member of a heist team that is going to put the new group on the map stealing the Jewel of Calquoon from the Ouzel's mansion, where it is on display for the Diamond Ball. Francesco, Guizam, and Francesco's cousin Marco leave through the sewers that night towards the Ouzel's mansion. Through the sewers they are attacked by a swarm of rats, who, despite being set on fire, nearly kill Marco. The party decides to wait for Marco to recover, though this means that they will arrive at the mansion at 5am, much later than they had planned. 

They sneak in through the laundry room, dressing themselves in servant's clothing, but whilst sneaking upstairs Guizam alerts the cook. Though his face is clearly recognisable to anyone who knows him, he manages to pass himself off as a new servant to the cook, and she gossips with him over tea (further delaying the heist). Once he escapes and finally gets upstairs the group's knowledge of traps and magic lets them know that the doors of the ballroom (where the diamond is kept) are warded to slam shut if certain conditions are met. They go in though the Smoking Room (decorated with no taste), leaving a couch in the door to ensure that it is wedged open. On the way Francesco swipes three fancy cigars. The diamond is held in the hands of a golden suit of armour in the centre of the room. Francesco successfully swipes it Indiana Jones-style (replacing it with a cigar case and hiding it in his backpack) but as he does so it animates as the ballroom doors slam shut. The halfings cannot run away fast enough and Francesco is felled by the animated armour. Marco goes to his aid, throwing the backpack to Guizam to kite the armour away but the plan fails and ultimately all three are knocked unconscious.

They come to at the dangerously late hour of 7am, seeing the statue resuming its place in the middle of the room, now holding Francesco's purple backpack. This time they come up with a noisy (plan) to swipe the backpack then immediately drop a chandelier on the armour to buy them enough time to get away. Though battered and bruised they succeed at this plan, rousing the household in the process. Once in the Smoking Room they move the couch and slam the door, trapping the armour in the ballroom. Guizam overrules Francesco to hide the backpack under a dusty cabinet, and as the cook arrives from downstairs begins to beat back on the door of the ballroom. They pass off the story that their injuries were gained in a scuffle with the actual thieves (including a wizard) and slip away through the sewers when they say that they are going to inform the City Watch. Francesco declares that they are all family now. In this familial spirit Guizam deigns to allow Marco to recover in his own house.

The next day, Guizam, Berem, Crusher and Francesco make the two day trip out on horseback to Appleby. After discovering that everyone in the town is named Giles whilst Francesco gets very drunk on cider in the local pub, they finally make it out to framer Giles' ("Mad Giles") farm. They hear noises outside and discover that the pumpkins are being gleefully wrecked by [[Factions:Kobolds|kobolds]]. They subdue seven kobolds as Berem incierates two, and a basically useless Francesco (riding on Crusher's shoulders) is knocked unconscious. They leave the kobolds in the dog kennels to come to overnight as Francesco recovers from his broken ribs.

**Session 2**

Guizam bargains with the captured kobold 'Marcus' to stop attacking the farmer's fields, as Berem convinces Giles not to let the dogs on them. Crusher gains a dog companion 'Ripper' and the two are instantly devoted to one another. Marcus cannot bargain on behalf of the whole load of kobolds, so leads Guizam, Berem, Crusher and Francesco towards the kobold warren, leaving them alone as he goes to fetch his 'boss'. The boss is a purple-and-cream kobold in a Centurion's helmet (Octavius). He agrees to a bargain: the kobolds leave this year's harvest alone, and pay back 20 gold as recompense to Giles, if the party free all captured kobolds and do some pest control for the kobold warren. Octavius doesn't actually know what has infested the warren, only that kobolds sent down there do not return.

He leads them through a heavily trapped entrance and takes down an improvised barricade (studded with broken bottles) to allow them to the infested area. They find a closed off section of the warren, apparently empty. Berem is caught by an improvised acid trap which Octavius forgot to warn them about. They invesigate a grey ooze in the sleeping area as Berem backs up into a gelatenous cube. Despite engulfing Berem three times (and dealing a festering burn wound) the cube is eventually defeated, but as Crusher's dog worries the grey ooze at their back it strikes and kills it outright. Crusher is distraught.

They finish off the clean out in a cursory way. When they meet Octavius again (who presents them with a boot full of gold) they are in no mood to entertain him. He asks if they still need the body of the dog and Crusher grabs him by the throat. He's unable to wiggle free before Francesco and Guizam stab him. Everyone is tired, acid burned, and very fond of that dog. A detatchment of kobolds try to rescue Octavius' body before he dies outright but retreat after they are unable to successfully swarm Crusher and one is stabbed through the throat. The party retreat, back into the tunnel section they just cleared out, and dump Octavius' body in the mushroom farm. When they return they see that the barricade has been reassembled, apparently trapping them in. They take a short rest in the store room.
